Here are my solutions for [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) exercises. A repo helps to keep myself accountable :-)

> (...) First, we want to es tablish the idea that a computer language is not just a way
> of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal
> medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, **programs must be written for
> people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.** Second, we believe
> that **the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is** not the
> syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever alforithms for
> computing particular function efficiently, nor even mathematical analysis of algorithms
> and the foundations of computing but rather **the techniques use to control the
> intellectual complexity of large software systems.**
